![JS-img](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/04/23/17/41/javascript-736400_1280.png)

The objective of this task is to learn the basics of the programming language **JavaScript**.

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. Its specialty lies in its ability to interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Here are some of its key features and uniqueness:

1. *Client-Side Scripting*

2. *Event-Driven*

3. *Asynchronous Programming*

4. *Dynamic Typing* 

5. *Prototype-based Inheritance* 

Important topics in JavaScript include:

1. *Basic Syntax and Data Types:* Understanding variables, operators, data types like strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and basic control flow structures like if statements and loops.

2. *Functions:* Learning about function declarations, expressions, anonymous functions, arrow functions, and function scope.

3. *DOM Manipulation:* Interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically change HTML and CSS, handling events, and updating page content.

4. *ES6+ Features:* Exploring new features introduced in (ES6) and later versions, such as let and const, arrow functions, classes, destructuring, spread/rest operators, and modules.

5. *Error Handling:* Handling errors gracefully using try-catch blocks and understanding common JavaScript errors.

#### My hands-on experience >>>>

I have created this wonderfull static webpage, **Student Performances Calculator** using JavaScript. It take name, marks of students through a **html** form and calculate the following results:

* Percentage of each student.
* Class average.
* Rankings of the students.
