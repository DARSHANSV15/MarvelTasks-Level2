Task 8 - Introduction to Cybersecurity
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)
The CIA triad stands as a fundamental framework for understanding and implementing effective security measures. These principles form the cornerstone of security strategies, guiding organizations in safeguarding their digital assets against a myriad of threats and vulnerabilities.

Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure.

Integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle. It involves safeguarding data from unauthorized alteration, corruption, or tampering.

Availability guarantees that information and resources are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users. It protects against disruptions, downtime, and denial-of-service attacks that could impair system functionality.

Common Types of Cyber Threats
Malware, short for malicious software, encompasses a broad category of malicious programs designed to infiltrate, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

Phishing is a form of cyber attack that involves fraudulent attempts to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as passwords, usernames, or financial data. Typically, phishing attacks occur via email, instant messaging, or social media, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities, such as banks, government agencies, or trusted organizations. By exploiting human trust and curiosity, phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to accounts.

Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human behavior and manipulate individuals into disclosing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking methods that target technical vulnerabilities, social engineering relies on psychological manipulation and social interaction to deceive victims.

Cybersecurity Frameworks and Standards
Cybersecurity frameworks and standards provide structured approaches, best practices, and guidelines for assessing, implementing, and managing cybersecurity controls. They help organizations establish effective cybersecurity programs, mitigate risks, and enhance resilience against cyber threats.

Some prominent cybersecurity frameworks and standards:

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
ISO/IEC 27001
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
CIS Controls
PCI DSS
