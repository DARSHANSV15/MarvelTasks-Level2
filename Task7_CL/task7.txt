Task 7 - Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing refers to data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than on our local computer.
The cloud is a place where large numbers of servers are stored and kept functional so as to provide services like running applications, storing data, data processing and web hosting.
A server is simply a computer with high end configuration that is kept functional all time.
